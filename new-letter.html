    <div class="letter"><h1>Chelsea &amp; Ridley's 2025&nbsp;Wrap-Up</h1>
    <p>
      Hello dear friend or family member! 👋
    </p>
    <p>
      You've been selected to receive this newsletter and we hope you read it... and like it! For those of you
      who don't know Ridley, he is a musician and artist from Phoenix, Arizona. If you don't know Chelsea, she's
      a poet and bookmaker from Milwaukee. We met in Appleton, Wisconsin at a poetry event in July 2023 and started dating over
      the next couple months. Ridley moved to Milwaukee in October of last year to be closer to Chelsea and the Bronze Fonz.
    </p>

    <p>2025 was in some ways a difficult year, but brought a lot of exciting changes to both of our lives. January saw Ridley
      start playing his first shows with his newly formed band <a class="link" href="https://www.poorridley.com">Poor Ridley</a>.
      They're a talented bunch of lads who went on a short tour in March around Wisconsin and Minnesota and have since played a share
      of bar and attic shows. Chelsea's poetry outfit <a class="link" href="https://www.pitymilkpress.com">pitymilk press</a>, which
      she runs with her publishing partner Edie Roberts, released five chapbooks this year, all designed, printed and assembled
      by hand and made available on their website and at book fairs and readings across the country.

      🛩 🌄 In February, we flew to Phoenix to visit Ridley's family for his 30th birthday. In addition to hanging out and half-watching the
      Super Bowl, we made a trip with Ridley's dad to the Grand Canyon and saw some other sights in the northern part of the state.
      It was a bittersweet trip as we stayed in the house where Ridley grew up that was on its way to being put back on the market, but we
      got to take home a modest selection of books from the soon-to-be-liquidated family library.

      🚙 📚 In April, Chelsea and Edie planned a two-week tour around their trip to the New Orleans Poetry Festival where they tabled their press and curated
      a poetry reading for the festival's programming. Chelsea even got to see one of her favorite living poets, Ariana Reines, read live. The trip marked
      many firsts for Chelsea. She had never been further south than Tennessee, let alone performed any of her poems in the southern region of the country.
      She also put her vegan lifestyle on hold to enjoy a shrimp po' boy and many beignets. The readings were very successful in building connections with
      other poets and bookmakers that she hopes to continue stoking.

      🏕 In June, Von Trier, the restaurant where Chelsea is a server, closed its doors for a few weeks during a transfer of ownership. With the
      time off from work while changes in management and operations were underway, we enjoyed a trip up to the Porcupine Mountains in Michigan's U.P.-- Ridley's first time visiting Lake Superior-- and camping on a little open patch
      just outside of the national forest. It was a rough dealing with an incessant storm of bugs, but we lasted for a couple nights and made some great
      meals and coffee before making our way down to Devil's Lake outside of Madison with a more accomodating campsite and beautiful hiking up the bluffs.
      On the way home, although exhausted, we walked through <a class="link" href="https://www.thehouseontherock.com">The House On The Rock</a>, Ridley's second time
      and Chelsea's first. There's a lot to take in, but it's always worth the trip!

      📦 Shortly after returning home, Ridley quit his job at Colectivo Coffee, a company that everyone should think twice before patronizing, and would
      encourage anyone considering quitting their job to make a good plan before doing so! Over the next few weeks, we moved Ridley into Chelsea's
      apartment (<i>our</i> apartment), an 1895 Polish flat upper unit in the Harambee neighborhood of Milwaukee. It was a lot of work moving
      all of the clothes, records, books, guitars, furniture, DVDs, electronics, computers, paintings and decorations, but as things
      continue to settle in, it starts to feel more and more like home.
    </p><p>
      Ridley's mom was able to visit and stay with us in July and we spent some good time being together, lounging, dining and watching TV. We also
      took a rewarding tour through the Milwaukee Art Museum, a trip down to the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, and she even got to catch a Dusk show.
      Soon after, Ridley's band Dusk headed on a three-week tour out to the west coast and back, during which he got to see some Twin Peaks shooting
      locations including the RR Diner, Snoqualmie Falls and the Sheriff's Station.

      ⛺ Late August saw us driving to western Michigan for Chelsea's aunt and uncle's anniversary party and family reunion of sorts. The first two nights, we stayed
      at an Air BNB on a farm property near Lake Michigan. The small space was a little more rustic than expected, but featured a full
      kitchen and bathroom only 10 yards away from the cabin... in the garage. We got to explore the nearby Silver Lake dunes and ogle the 4-wheelers
      zipping around in the sand. We headed south the next day and checked out the incredible Midwest Miniatures Museum in Grand Haven. For our
      final night, we headed south to a campground, pitched our tent, cooked a luxurious dinner over the fire and toasted marshmallows.

      🍁 🎃 Autumn brought a refreshing breeze after a hot summer and we were happy to have a chilly day for our third annual trip to <a class="link" href="https://bassesfarms.com">Basse's
      Farms</a> just outside of the city. In addition to the tractor ride into the pumpkin patch to choose our soon-to-be jack-o-lanterns, our favorite
      attractions are the giant mooing cow piano, hook and ring game, "Big Chair", and feeding the eager goats, goofy llamas and the sweetest old donkey.
      Aside from being our favorite season, Fall also homes Chelsea's birthday, which we celebrated this year with a couples massage, vegan nachos,
      a backyard cookout and a picnic in the park with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      After another Dusk tour out the east coast in October, Ridley had the honor of officiating the wedding of two dear friends, Micayla and Jeremiah, in Appleton, Wisconsin on November 1st. With that experience and a
      speech at his very good friend Gabriel's wedding last year under his belt, Ridley's considering a career in matrimology.

      🐱 Santa brought an early present in late November, when we adopted the sweet tomcat Stanley, who was born and living among a colony of ferals until
      he was trapped and brought inside by a foster who works with a local rescue shelter. He was timid at first and hid under our coats in the closet, but
      Ridley was able to coax him out with treats and then he was well on his way to acclimating to the space, us and his new brother Coco. Being only
      about two years old and having the mind of an outdoor cat, he's been a bit of a handful as we work to get him into our routine and away from his
      bad habits, of which the angel Coco possesses none. He's making great progress becoming a member of the family and Ridley even caught the two
      boys sleeping together in the new cozy bed they got for Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      🎅 We first celebrated the holiday season with our annual trip to <a class="link" href="https://candycanelanewi.com">Candy Cane Lane</a>, a clump of eight neighborhood blocks decked out
      with lights and decorations. In keeping with another classic tradition, Ridley underdressed and nearly froze his toes off. After baking
      blackberry and strawberry thumbprint and sugar-coated molasses cookies (and puppy chow), we hosted Chelsea's parents and sister at our
      place on Christmas Eve, which was special for many reasons and altogether a smashing success. Christmas Day we headed to Chelsea's Aunt Nee-Nee
      and Uncle Mark's house for presents and hangs with some more of her family, followed by a date to see Chloe Zhao's <i>Hamnet</i> (averaging a
      4.5-star rating and three quarts of tears between the two of us) at the Downer Theater and a casual dinner of Chinese takeout to top it all off.
      Amidst the festivites, Ridley also started a job at Blick Art Materials in the Third Ward which he's very thankful to have been offered and excited
      to see where it takes him.

      As the light of the new year crowns over the horizon, we've enjoyed looking back at photos and remembering all of the fun
      things we experienced in 2025 together and apart and we're looking ahead to the exciting ones yet to come. Look out for Poor Ridley
      and Dusk shows in your area, and a new book of poems from Chelsea, due Spring 2026. We hope to see you soon! Take care and love yourself.
